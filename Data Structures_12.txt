-Binary Trees

-Tree is a type of graph

-Graph theory => very complex subject area

-In coding interviews, trees are quite simple

-Root node => top node

-child nodes => nodes below

-directed structure => usually point downward in tree
*i.e. top to bottom

-acyclic => does not have cycles (not allowed in tree)
*would become normal graph

-each node can only have one parent

-cannot be disconnected or we would have two different trees

-Types of trees:

*binary tree=> normal tree, where every node has at most two child nodes

*ternary tree => each node has at most three child nodes

*k-ary trees => each node has at most k child nodes

*Binary search trees(BSTs)

*Heaps(min/max heaps) => typically binary

*Tries => usually stores characters in a string

-Most trees dont have pointers from child to parent but we can have them
if we want

-storing a tree is O(N) S
*Where N is the number of nodes in tree

-traversing all N nodes in tree => O(N) T

-traversing through one of two subtrees(for binary tree) => O(log(N)) T
^if balanced binary tree
*if tree is skewed, time complexity would be different

-balance => maintains log(N) time complexity for traversing one of two subtrees
every time
*roughly even on both sides of the tree

-unless guaranteed that tree is balanced, must state that it is only log(N)
on average
*worst case is O(N) time

-Vocabulary:
*branch => any path that starts at the root node and ends at a bottom node
*leaf node => bottom node
*level => every level in a tree
^in a family tree, parents would be a level, sibiling would be level below
*complete tree => every level is full, and final level can be partially empty
but must be filled left to right
*full => if every node in a tree has no children nodes or k children nodes
*in a k-ary tree
*perfect tree => all leaf nodes have same depth
*depth/height => how far down a tree goes(number of levels in a tree)

-a full tree does not have to be a complete tree
-a complete tree does not have to be a full tree
