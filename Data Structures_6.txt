-discuss array functions, how they are stored in memory, and BigO

-stored back to back
*3 64 bit numbers = 24 slots back to back
^64 bit is 8 bytes each

-Two types of arrays:
*static and dynamic arrays

-Static arrays have a fixed number of memory slots
*seen in C++ and java

-operations of array:
*array[2] = very basic almost instant O(1)

-operating system finds start of memory slot then find index specified
by adding how many bytes is needed to starting address
*i.e. if slot 3 is the first memory slot used we can add 8 to it
to find the second 64 bit number in an array

-array[2] = 5
^setting is similar to getting
*can find the address quickly and override with new binary numbers
**constant time and constant space O(1)

-init => O(8*N) making array of certain length
