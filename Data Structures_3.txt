-foundational knowledge of memory is important too

-we want to understand (when we write code) how things work under the hood
*i.e. writing variables

-memory is a large topic, we will simplify a lot of things

^this makes video relevant to interviews

- we declare variables then use them later on in code
*variable has to be stored

-bounded (memory) canvas = finite(limited) number of (memory) slots

^if all slots are taken, there would be no available slots
**we want to take up less memory if possible

-making new variable = variable will be stored in memory canvas
**one memory slot will be taken up(not free anymore)
^or series of memory slots will be taken up

-will always be stored in memory slot that is free (not taken up)

-if more than one block needed, it will be stored in back to back memory slots

-memory = made of bits = 0s and 1s

-computer only understands 0s and 1s

-1 slot = 8 bits = 1 byte

-binary number = base 2 system

-lookup binary system on wikipedia if confused
