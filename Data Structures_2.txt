############################Complexity-Analysis#####################################

-foundation of data structures

-one problem can have multiple solutions (3 or 4)

-some solutions are a lot better than others

-better complexity means better solution

-complexity = cs concept of time complexity and space complexity

^space time complexity

-time complexity = how fast an algorithm runs

-space complexity = how much memory an algorithm takes

-better solution = better time complexity or better space complexity

^may depend on use-case of solution

-figuring out which is better = comparing space time complexity

-complexity analysis = figuring out the complexity of an algorithm

-must be familiar with all the space time complexities of popular algorithms

-solutions ideally should be fast and require low memory usage
